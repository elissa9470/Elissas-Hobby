<h1>Driving</h1>

<h2>Introduction to my hobby</h2>

<p>My name is Elissa. My hobby is driving. I'm very good at driving, and my favorite car to drive is my mom's<a href="http://automobiles.honda.com/odyssey/"> minivan</a>. I've never seen a cooler car than this.</p>

<p>The best part about driving is when my mom sits in the passenger's seat. I LOVE getting yelled at by her! I also enjoy pulling up to events in the minivan to make my peers jealous.</p>

<p>I also love to drive 20 mph under the speed limit. Most people think that going fast is cool, but I think going really slow makes you look even cooler. If you want to feel cool like me, you might want to buy<a href="https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/inventorylisting/viewDetailsFilterViewInventoryListing.action?sourceContext=carGurusHomePage_false_0&formSourceTag=104&entitySelectingHelper.selectedEntity=d592&zip=29681#listing=135318849"> this</a>. My mom's is a lot cooler because it has a movie screen, but that's ok.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Driving a Minivan</h2>

<p>There are many advantages to driving a minivan. You can drive SEVEN friends around, and watch movies in the back seat. The biggest advantage, however, is that if you were to ever commit a crime, nobody would suspect the owner of a maroon Honda Odyssey. Spectators would most likely think that you're an innocent mother of 3. Not that I would ever commit a crime, because that would end badly and that would be embarrassing.</p>
